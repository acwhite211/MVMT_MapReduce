4. Relevant Information Paragraph:
	The data directory contains the binary images (masks) of the leaf samples. The colour images are not included.
	The data set features are organised as the following:
	'data_Sha_64.txt'
	'data_Tex_64.txt'
	'data_Mar_64.txt'

	One file for each 64-element feature vectors. Each row begins with the class label.
	The remaining 64 elements is the feature vector.

5. Number of Instances

	1600 samples each of three features (16 samples per leaf class).

6. Number of Attributes

   	Three 64 element feature vectors per sample.

7. Vectors
	There are three features: Shape, Margin and Texture. As discussed in the paper(s) above.
	For Each feature, a 64 element vector is given per sample of leaf.
	These vectors are taken as a contigous descriptors (for shape) or histograms (for texture and margin).

8. Missing Attribute Values: none

9. Class Distribution: 16 instances per class
